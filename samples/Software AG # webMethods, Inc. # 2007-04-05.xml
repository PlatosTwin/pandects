The Offer shall be subject to the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder) and not properly withdrawn, a number of Shares that, together with the Shares then owned beneficially by Parent and/or Merger Sub (together with their wholly-owned subsidiaries), represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (the “Minimum Condition”) and to the other conditions set forth in Annex I. Merger Subsidiary expressly reserves the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing, (i) the Minimum Condition may not be waived, (ii) no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid, decreases the Offer Price or the number of Shares sought in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I or otherwise amends or modifies the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares and (iii) the Offer may not be extended except as set forth in this Section 1.1(a).

Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and to correct any material omissions in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents.

The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Merger Sub confirming (i) the number of Shares then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, and (ii) the number of Top-Up Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor.</text>
        <text>(c) At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a certificate or certificates evidencing the applicable number of Top-Up Option Shares, and Merger Sub shall purchase each Top-Up Option Share from the Company at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price.

        <text>(d) Upon the delivery by Merger Sub to the Company of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, and the tender of the consideration described in Section 1.4(c), Merger Sub shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon that exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be closed or that certificates representing those Top-Up Option Shares shall not then be actually delivered to Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed or refused to designate the account described in Section 1.4(c).</text>
        <text>(e) Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares may include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.</text>
        <text>(f) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an “accredited investor”, as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top- Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).</text>

        <text>(b) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, each Company Employee with compensation (including bonus and incentive compensation opportunities, but excluding equity-based compensation) and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits provided to Parent’s similarly-situated employees employed in the same country as such Company Employee (or, if Parent has no employees employed in such country, as provided to such Company Employee) as of the Closing Date, as the same may be modified or adjusted from time to time thereafter.

        <text>(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect (or Parent may instead elect to maintain pursuant to Parent’s policy or policies) for the benefit of the Company’s current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that is substantially equivalent to the Company’s existing policy on terms with respect to coverage in the aggregate no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof, or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for such insurance in excess of 250% of the last annual premiums paid prior to the date hereof (which premiums the Company has disclosed to Parent), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.</text>
        <text>(c) This Section 6.10 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each indemnified party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the indemnified parties.

Parent shall promptly provide the Company with the documentation evidencing any replacement or alternative sources of financing and shall give the Company prompt notice (but in any event within two Business Days) of any material breach by any party to the Commitment Letter or any termination of the Commitment Letter.

Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith, except for any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties that arise out of or relate to (i) information furnished to Parent by the Company for use in connection with the Financing or (ii) information contained in the Company SEC Reports. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in paragraph (e) of Annex I of this Agreement, as it applies to the Company’s obligations under this Section 6.11(b), shall be deemed satisfied unless the Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Company’s willful and material breach of its obligations under this Section 6.11(b).</text>
