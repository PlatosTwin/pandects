      <section title="4.2. Exchange of Certificates." order="2" standardId="548712c819448635">

Simultaneously with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the Company’s prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (the “Paying Agent“), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately available funds sufficient for the Paying Agent to make payments (i) under Section 4.1(a) and (ii) in respect of Company Options pursuant to Section 4.3(a) and Company Awards pursuant to Section 4.3(b) (such aggregate cash amount in clauses (i) and (ii) being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Fund“). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard &amp; Poor’s Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker’s acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three months.

Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(e)) or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares may be issued to such transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.</text>
        <text>(c) Transfers. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.</text>
        <text>(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates) or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.</text>

        <text>(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.</text>
        <text>(f) Appraisal Rights. No Person who has perfected a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such Person’s right to appraisal under the DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the Company relating to stockholders’ rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.</text>
        <text>(g) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it reasonably determines in good faith it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code“), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 5.1(n)) Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be.</text>

        <text>Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time that, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if the Company has otherwise complied in all material respects with this Section 6.2, the Company may (A) provide information in response to a request therefor by a Person (other than any Affiliate of the Company) who has made an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of Directors believes in good faith to be bona fide providing for the acquisition of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or total voting power of the equity securities of the Company if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not more favorable to such other Person than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7); and promptly discloses (and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such information to Parent to the extent not previously provided to Parent; (B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal of the type described in clause (A) above; or (C) after having complied with Section 6.2(c), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal; (x) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith based on the information then available and (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal (as defined below) or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal; and (y) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.</text>
        <text>(b) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:</text>
        <definition standardID="6ac95f89defd0a11">“Acquisition Proposal” means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries and (ii) any acquisition by any Person, or proposal or offer, which if consummated would result in any Person becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related transactions, 15% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company or those of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or 15% or more of the consolidated total assets (including equity securities of its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.</definition>

        <definition standardID="5381b58174a51b09">“Superior Proposal” means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal in connection with which there has been no material violation of this Section 6.2 that would result in any Person (or its stockholders) becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the assets (on a consolidated basis) or more than 50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company that the board of directors of the Company has determined in its good faith judgment is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the Company’s stockholders from a financial point of view than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by Section 6.2(c) of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.2(c)).</definition>
        <text>(c) No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement. The board of directors of the Company and each committee of the board of directors shall not:</text>
        <text>(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger; or</text>
        <text>(ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section 8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in compliance with Section 6.2(a)) (an “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) relating to any Acquisition Proposal.</text>
        <text>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify the Company Recommendation or approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal not knowingly solicited, entered into or agreed to in breach of this Section 6.2 and made after the date of this Agreement, if the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law (a “Change of Recommendation”); provided, however, that no Change of Recommendation may be made until after at least 72 hours following Parent’s receipt of notice from the Company advising that management of the Company currently intends to recommend to its board of directors that it take such action and the basis therefor, including all required information under Section 6.2(f). In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, the board of directors of the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and any other information provided by Parent. Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.2.</text>

        <text>(d) Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under United States federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that if such disclosure includes a Change of Company Recommendation or has the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4 (it being understood that any “stop, look or listen” communication that contains only the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be deemed a Change of Company Recommendation or be deemed to have the substantive effort of withdrawing or adversely modifying the Company Recommendation).</text>
        <text>(e) Existing Discussions.

The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis (which shall be considered in light of the circumstances of such proposal or offer and the time by which Parent has the opportunity to respond), of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto).</text>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 6.5(b), shall require, or be construed to require, Parent to proffer to, or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate, or actually to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber or hold separate, before or after the Effective Time, any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer, disposition or other encumberment by the Company of any of its assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein or to any agreement by the Company to take any of the foregoing actions) or to agree to any material changes (including through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of, Parent’s ability to own or operate any of such assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein or Parent’s ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the stock of the Surviving Corporation (any of the foregoing, “Detriments”); provided, however, that in order to ensure that Governmental Antitrust Entities with the authority to clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Merger do so by the Termination Date, Parent shall agree to one or more Detriments provided that such Detriments would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a reduction of assets, categories of assets, businesses or investments that generated in the aggregate more than 5% of the sum of the 2007 gross sales and investment income of Parent and the Company, including their respective Subsidiaries, on a combined basis net of any ongoing annual royalty payments or other ongoing revenue contributions expected to be received as a result of effectuating such Detriments (“Detriments Limit”). If Governmental Antitrust Entities require that Parent agree to Detriments that would in the aggregate exceed the Detriment Limit and if, as a result, any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted or threatened to be instituted by one or more Governmental Antitrust Entities challenging the Merger as violative of law, Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate and to contest and resist, except insofar as Parent and the Company otherwise may agree, one or more of such actions or proceedings; provided, however, that Parent in its sole discretion may decide which actions or proceedings to contest, if such selected actions or proceedings, if successfully contested, in the aggregate would result in the Detriments not exceeding the Detriments Limit. The Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this Section 6.5(b), each of the Company and Parent agree to promptly provide to each and every Governmental Antitrust Entity non-privileged information and documents (i) requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or (ii) that are necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

The Company shall not participate in any meeting or discussion initiated by any Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to any filings, applications, investigation, or other inquiry regarding the Merger or filings under any pre-merger notification rules, without giving Parent reasonable prior notice of the meeting or discussion and, to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Antitrust Entity, the opportunity to attend and participate. In addition, the Company shall not initiate any offer to any Governmental Antitrust Entity with respect to any proposed Detriment.

If any Detriment agreed to by Parent requires action by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, Parent hereby agrees to consent to the taking of such action by the Company and any such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon consummation of the Merger.</text>
