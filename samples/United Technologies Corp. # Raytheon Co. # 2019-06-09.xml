The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares then held by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares with respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly</text>

The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this Section</text>
        <text>3.1(c) is not separately bargained-for consideration.</text>
        <text>(d) No Dissenters’ Rights. In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of Raytheon Common Stock or UTC Common Stock in connection with the Merger.</text>

For purposes of this Agreement, “UTC Alternative Transaction” means any of (1) a transaction or series of transactions pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) other than Raytheon and its subsidiaries (such person (or group of persons), a “UTC Third Party”), or the direct or indirect stockholders of such UTC Third Party or the resulting company, acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of, or would otherwise own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the outstanding shares of UTC Common Stock or securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities) representing more than 20% or more of the equity or voting power of UTC (or the resulting company), (2) a merger, consolidation, share exchange or similar transaction pursuant to which any UTC Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, assets or businesses of UTC RemainCo or any of its subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of UTC RemainCo and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (3) any transaction pursuant to which any UTC Third Party acquires or would acquire, directly or indirectly, control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of UTC RemainCo and any entity surviving any merger or combination including any of them) of UTC RemainCo or any of its subsidiaries representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of UTC RemainCo and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (4) any disposition of assets of UTC RemainCo or its subsidiaries to a UTC Third Party representing more than 20% or more of the revenues, net income or assets (in each case on a consolidated basis) of UTC RemainCo and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For purposes of this Agreement, an “UTC Superior Proposal” means any bona fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a UTC Third Party to enter into a UTC Alternative Transaction (with all references to 20% in the definition of UTC Alternative Transaction being treated as references to 50% for these purposes) that (A) did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3(a), (B) is on terms that the Board of Directors of UTC determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) to be superior from a financial point of view to UTC’s stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all relevant factors (including any changes to this Agreement that may be proposed by Raytheon in response to such proposal to enter into a UTC Alternative Transaction and the identity of the person making such proposal to enter into a UTC Alternative Transaction) and (C) is reasonably likely to be completed in accordance with its terms, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal, and is not subject to a diligence or financing condition.</text>
        <text>(b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.3(b) or Section 5.3(d), neither the Board of Directors of UTC nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner adverse to Raytheon, the approval or recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the Merger or this Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any UTC Alternative Transaction, (iii) fail to include in the Joint Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Board of Directors of UTC in favor of this Agreement and the UTC Share Issuance, (iv) fail to send to its securityholders, within ten (10) business days after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer relating to shares of UTC Common Stock (or, if earlier, at least two (2) business days prior to the UTC Stockholders Meeting), a statement disclosing that UTC recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer and reaffirming its</text>

        <text>recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger or (v) fail to publicly reaffirm its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger within ten (10) business days of Raytheon’s written request to do so (or, if earlier, at least two (2) business days prior to the UTC Stockholders’ Meeting) following the public announcement of any UTC Alternative Transaction (or any material amendment, including any change to the price or form of consideration); provided, that Raytheon shall not be entitled to make such written request, and the Board of Directors of UTC shall not be required to make such reaffirmation, more than once with respect to any particular UTC Alternative Transaction (or any material amendment thereto, including any change to the price or form of consideration) (any action or failure to act in clauses (i) through (v) being referred to as a “UTC</text>
        <text>Recommendation Change”). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, prior to obtaining the UTC Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of UTC determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that it has received a UTC Superior Proposal that was not solicited, initiated, knowingly encouraged or facilitated or otherwise procured in violation of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of UTC may effect a UTC Recommendation Change (other than under clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(b)) if (A) the Board of Directors of UTC determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (B) UTC has notified Raytheon in writing that it intends to effect a UTC Recommendation Change pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) (other than under clause (ii) of this Section</text>
        <text>5.3(b)), (C) UTC has provided Raytheon with a copy of the proposed definitive agreements and other proposed transaction documentation between UTC and the person making such UTC Superior Proposal, and the identity of the person making such UTC Superior Proposal, (D) for a period of four (4) business days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (B) of this Section 5.3(b), UTC shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith and made UTC’s Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Raytheon desires to negotiate) with Raytheon’s Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under Applicable Law of the Board of Directors of UTC (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term or condition of any UTC Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (I) two (2) business days following delivery of such new notice from UTC to Raytheon and (II) the expiration of the original four (4)-business day period described in clause (D) above), and (E) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Board of Directors of UTC shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that (x) the UTC Alternative Transaction that is the subject of the notice described in clause (B) above still constitutes a UTC Superior Proposal and (y) the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. Neither the Board of Directors of UTC nor any committee thereof shall cause or permit UTC or any of its controlled affiliates to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement related to any UTC Alternative Transaction or requiring, or reasonably likely to cause, UTC to terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the consummation of the Merger (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.3(a)).</text>

        <text>5.3(b), UTC shall promptly, and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt thereof, advise Raytheon orally and in writing of any request for information or proposal relating to a UTC Alternative Transaction, the material terms and conditions of such request or proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the person making such request or proposal. UTC shall (i) keep Raytheon reasonably informed of the status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or proposal on a reasonably current basis and (ii) provide to Raytheon as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other written materials exchanged between UTC or its subsidiaries or any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any person making such request or proposal or any of its Representatives, on the other hand, in each case that describes or contains any such request or proposal.</text>
        <text>(d) Other than in connection with a UTC Superior Proposal (which shall be subject to Section 5.3(b) and shall not be subject to this Section 5.3(d)), prior to obtaining the UTC Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of UTC may, in response to a UTC Intervening Event, take any action prohibited by clauses (i) or (iii) of Section 5.3(b), only if (i) the Board of Directors of UTC determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (ii) UTC has notified Raytheon in writing that it intends to effect such a UTC Recommendation Change (under clauses (i) or (iii) of Section 5.3(b)) pursuant to this Section 5.3(d) (which notice shall specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the UTC Intervening Event and for the determination by the Board of Directors of UTC to effect a UTC Recommendation Change under clauses (i) or (iii) of Section 5.3(b) in reasonable detail), (iii) for a period of four (4) business days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this Section 5.3(d), UTC shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith and made UTC’s Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Raytheon desires to negotiate) with Raytheon’s Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under Applicable Law of the Board of Directors of UTC (it being understood and agreed that any material change to the relevant facts and circumstances shall require a new notice and a new negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (A) two (2) business days following delivery of such new notice from UTC to Raytheon and (B) the expiration of the original four (4)-business day period described above in this clause (iii)), and (iv) no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Board of Directors of UTC shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this Agreement, that the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. The term “UTC Intervening Event” means a material event or circumstance that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of UTC on the date of this Agreement (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable to the Board of Directors of UTC of the date of this Agreement), which event or circumstance, or any consequence thereof, becomes known to the Board of Directors of UTC prior to the UTC Stockholder Approval; provided, that (1) in no event shall any inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a UTC Alternative Transaction constitute a UTC</text>

For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and UTC shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses equivalent to the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of Raytheon and the Bylaws of Raytheon as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any D&amp;O Indemnified Parties; provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim made for indemnification within such period shall continue until the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim.

If Raytheon or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such “tail” insurance policies prior to, as of or after the Effective Time, UTC shall, for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Raytheon with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; provided that, after the Effective Time, UTC shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by Raytheon prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.</text>
