        <text>(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6(a), Section 2.6(c) and Section 2.6(d), and subject to any Adjustment pursuant to Section 2.10, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall automatically be converted into the right to receive (i) $30.00 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration”), and (ii) that number of validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the “Stock Consideration” and, together with the Cash Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Company Common Stock that are in non-certificated book-entry form (either case being referred to in this Agreement, to the extent applicable, a “Certificate”) shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or other distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with this Article II upon the surrender of such Certificate.</text>

Parent will make available to the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, (i) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to pay the aggregate Stock Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(b), (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6(b) and (iii) cash in an amount sufficient to make all requisite payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.7(e) (such cash and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the “Exchange Fund”). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or by appropriate guarantee of delivery in the form customarily used in transactions of this nature from a member of a national securities exchange, a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States) for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof, and any dividends or other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(d)(i).

Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or compliance with Parent’s customary procedure with respect to the exchange of Book Entry Shares, will be entitled to receive (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.6 and (ii) a check in the amount equal to the cash portion of the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.6 and this Article II, including dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.7(d) and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.7(e). No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration and any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Sections 2.7(b) and 2.7(d), and any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.7(e).</text>

If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to or registered in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment or registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result of such payment or registration in the name of a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.</text>
        <text>(d) Dividends and Distributions; Voting.</text>
        <text>(i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares until such Certificates or Book Entry Shares are properly surrendered. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.</text>
        <text>(ii) Holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any stockholders meeting of Parent the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder in respect of such Certificates, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Certificates, and Parent agrees to treat holders of unsurrendered certificates as holders of record of Parent for purposes of notice and voting.</text>
        <text>(e) Fractional Shares.</text>
        <text>(i) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.7(e), a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time) by the Closing Date Parent Closing Price. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.</text>
        <text>(ii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock without interest, subject to and in accordance with this Section 2.7.</text>
        <text>(f) No Further Ownership Rights. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the</text>

        <text>(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.</text>
        <text>(h) No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash or Parent Common Stock from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official to the extent required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise irrevocably escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.</text>
        <text>(i) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and, if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in respect of such lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.7(d)(i), with respect to each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.</text>
        <text>(j) Withholding Rights. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock (or with respect to all amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.6) pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any other provision of applicable United States federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of the shares of Company Common Stock (or to the recipient of any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.6) in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.</text>

Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) or publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any committee thereof of this Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative Transaction Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a “Company Adverse Recommendation Change”) or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement, arrangement or understanding (A) constituting, or relating to, any Alternative Transaction Proposal or (B) requiring it (or that would require it) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

        <text>(iii) the Company has (A) provided to Parent five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (including the per share value of the consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the Person or group of Persons making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the “Alternative Acquisition Agreement”) (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new five (5) Business Day period) and (3) that it intends to terminate this Agreement, and the manner in which it intends to do so, and (B) prior to terminating this Agreement, to the extent requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal;</text>
        <text>(iv) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any revised terms offered by Parent, the failure to terminate this Agreement and enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;</text>
        <text>(v) the Company shall have complied with Section 5.2(a) and shall not have breached any of the other provisions set forth in this Section 5.2 in any material respect; and</text>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.2(d) or in any other provision of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (other than in response to a Superior Proposal) if it determines in good faith after consultation with its legal and financial advisors that the failure to make such change would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, that (i) the Company has provided to Parent five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) during such five (5) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in a manner that obviates the need for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change.</text>
        <text>(f) Tender Offer Rules. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company (other than a Company Adverse Recommendation Change which shall be made only in accordance with Section 5.2(d) or 5.2(e), as applicable) if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that any action taken or disclosure made under this Section 5.2(f) shall not limit or modify the effect that any such action or disclosure may have under any other provision of this Agreement.</text>
