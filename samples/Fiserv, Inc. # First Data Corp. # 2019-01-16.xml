        <text>(a) Treatment of Company Stock Options. Immediately after the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a “Company Stock Option”) granted under the Company 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of the Company and its affiliates (collectively, the “Company Stock Plans”), whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent an option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to purchase a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (such option, a “Converted Stock Option”) equal to the product (with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Converted Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each Converted Stock Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting (and acceleration thereof upon the Closing, to the extent provided therein), forfeiture and exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Stock Option at the Effective Time; provided, however, that (1) to the extent that any Company Stock Option that is subject to vesting solely upon achievement of a target price per share of Company Common Stock (such price, the “Target Price” and such Company Stock Option, a “Target Price Option”)) would, by its terms, expire as of the Effective Time, such Target Price Option shall be amended such that it will not expire upon the Effective Time and shall instead become a Converted Stock Option, and remain eligible to vest upon satisfaction of the applicable Target Price, as adjusted to equal the initial Target Price divided by the Exchange Ratio (the “Adjusted Target Price”), (2) all Converted Stock Options held by a Company Employee (other than any Converted Stock Option with an Adjusted Target Price) shall vest in their entirety to the extent such Company Employee undergoes a Covered Termination and (3) all Converted Stock Options with an Adjusted Target Price held by a Company Employee shall be cancelled for no consideration or payment to the extent such Company Employee undergoes any termination of employment (including a Covered Termination) and at the time of such termination, the Adjusted Target Price is not achieved. For purposes hereof, a “Covered Termination” means, with respect to a Company Employee, (A) an involuntary termination of such Company Employee’s employment initiated by the Company that would result in the payment of severance benefits under the applicable Company Benefit Plan under which such Company Employee is eligible for severance benefits or (B) such Company Employee resigns from employment as a result of a material diminution in (I) the duties or responsibilities of such Company Employee as of the date of this Agreement, or (II) the base salary or annual incentive compensation opportunity afforded to such Company Employee as of the date of this Agreement, in each case, to the extent that such termination or resignation occurs on or following the date of this Agreement and on or prior to</text>

        <text>(b) Treatment of Company Restricted Shares. Immediately after the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted share award granted under the Company Stock Plans (a “Company Restricted Share”) shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted share of Company Class A Common Stock and shall be converted into a number of restricted shares of Parent Common Stock (each, a “Converted Restricted Share”) equal to the product (with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Company Restricted Shares subject to such award multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such Converted Restricted Share shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting (and acceleration thereof upon the Closing, to the extent provided therein) and forfeiture terms) as were applicable to the corresponding Company Restricted Share at the Effective Time; provided, however, that (A) to the extent that any Company Restricted Share that is subject to vesting solely upon achievement of a Target Price (a “Target Price Restricted Share”) would, by its terms, expire as of the Effective Time, such Target Price Restricted Share shall be amended such that it will not expire upon the Effective Time and shall instead become a Converted Restricted Share, and remain eligible to vest upon satisfaction of the applicable Adjusted Target Price, and (B) all Converted Restricted Shares held by a Company Employee (other than any Converted Restricted Share with an Adjusted Target Price) shall vest in their entirety to the extent such Company Employee undergoes a Covered Termination and (C) all Converted Restricted Shares with an Adjusted Target Price held by a Company Employee shall be cancelled for no consideration or payment to the extent such Company Employee undergoes any termination of employment (including a Covered Termination) and at the time of such termination, the Adjusted Target Price is not achieved.</text>
        <text>(c) Treatment of Company RSUs. Immediately after the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted stock unit granted under the Company Stock Plans (a “Company RSU”), shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Company Class A Common Stock and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Parent Common Stock (a “Converted Parent RSU”). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Converted Parent RSU shall equal to the product (with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number of shares of Company Class A Common Stock subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such</text>

        <text>Converted Parent RSU shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting (and acceleration thereof upon the Closing, to the extent provided therein), forfeiture and settlement terms) as were applicable to the corresponding Company RSU at the Effective Time; provided, however, that (A) to the extent that any Company RSU that is subject to vesting solely upon achievement of a Target Price (a “Target Price RSU”) would, by its terms, expire as of the Effective Time, such Target Price RSU shall be amended such that it will not expire upon the Effective Time and instead shall become a Converted Parent RSU, and remain eligible to vest upon satisfaction of the applicable Adjusted Target Price, (B) all Converted Parent RSUs held by a Company Employee (other than any Converted Parent RSUs with an Adjusted Target Price) shall vest in their entirety to the extent such Company Employee undergoes a Covered Termination and (C) all Converted Parent RSUs with an Adjusted Target Price held by a Company Employee shall be cancelled for no consideration or payment to the extent such Company Employee undergoes any termination of employment (including a Covered Termination) and at the time of such termination, the Adjusted Target Price is not achieved.</text>
        <text>(d) Treatment of Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions (including obtaining any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a committee thereof and, if appropriate, amending the terms of the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Company ESPP”)) that may be necessary or required under the Company ESPP and applicable Laws to ensure that (i) except for the offering period under the Company ESPP that commenced on January 1, 2019 (the “Final Offering”), no offering period shall be authorized or commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (ii) the Company shall not take any action to reduce the applicable purchase price for a share of Company Class A Common Stock under the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement, (iii) if the Closing shall occur prior to the end of the Final Offering, the Final Offering shall end on the Closing Date, (iv) each participant’s accumulated contributions under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase shares of Company Class A Common Stock in accordance with the Company ESPP as of the end of the Final Offering, (v) participants in the Company ESPP are not permitted to increase deductions under the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement and no new participants may begin participation in the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement, and (vi) the Company ESPP shall terminate in its entirety at the Effective Time and no further rights shall be granted or exercised under the Company ESPP thereafter.</text>
        <text>(e) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board (the “Company Compensation Committee”), as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to (i) effectuate the treatment of the Company Stock Options, the Company Restricted Shares and the Company RSUs pursuant to Section 1.8(a) through 1.8(c) and (ii) provide for the deduction, withholding and remittance of any amounts required pursuant to Section 2.2(f).

        <text>(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one (1) or more Old Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting of a bond in a reasonable and customary amount as indemnity pursuant to Section 2.2(g)) to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting of a bond in a reasonable and customary amount as indemnity pursuant to Section 2.2(g)) in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate or Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old Certificates, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu of a fractional share which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares.</text>
        <text>(b) If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.</text>

        <text>(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former stockholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the volume-weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) as such daily volume-weighted average price per share is reported by Bloomberg L.P. (or, if such information is no longer reported by Bloomberg L.P., as reported by a comparable internationally recognized source mutually determined by Parent and the Company) calculated for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (with the result rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5.</text>
        <text>(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates pursuant to this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.</text>

The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term “Material Adverse Effect” means, with respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (provided, however, that none of the following, either individually or in the aggregate, shall be deemed to constitute or be taken into account when determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred: (i) changes, after the date hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), (ii) changes, after the date hereof, in Laws of general applicability, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (iii) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political conditions (including acts of war (whether or not declared), civil disobedience, hostilities, terrorism, military actions or the escalation or worsening of any of the foregoing) or in economic conditions or financial markets (including securities, capital, equity, credit and debt markets) conditions in the United States or elsewhere in the world, (iv) a decline, in and of itself, in the trading price or trading volume of a party’s common stock, a credit ratings downgrade or change in ratings outlook, in and of itself, for a party or any of its Subsidiaries or the failure, in and of itself, to meet analyst earnings projections, earnings guidance or internal financial forecasts, but, in each case, not including the underlying causes thereof, (v) except for purposes of Section 3.3, changes, after the date hereof, arising out of, or resulting from, the execution and delivery of this Agreement, or public disclosure of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, public disclosure or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including any effect on a party’s relationships with its customers, suppliers, licensors, landlords, joint venture partners, unions or employees) or actions expressly required by this Agreement in contemplation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (vi) changes or developments in the financial services industry generally, (vii) any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (viii) any changes or developments resulting from any hurricane, flood, tornado, earthquake or other weather or natural disaster, or (ix) actions or omissions taken pursuant to the written consent of Parent, in the case of the Company, or the Company, in the case of Parent; except, with respect to subclauses (i), (ii), (iii), (vi) or (viii), to the extent that the effects of such change are materially disproportionately adverse to the business, properties, assets, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies in the industry in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate).

        <text>(k) Except as would not be reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, all Non-U.S. Parent Benefit Plans comply with applicable local Law, and all such plans that are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved are funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

        <text>(a) Assuming the truth and accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties set forth in Article III and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder, in each case, in all material respects, and assuming satisfaction of the conditions in Article VII (other than the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) and those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), Parent and Merger Sub will have available to them at the Effective Time all funds and commitments necessary to refinance in full all amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement, the Company Receivables Financing Agreement and the Company Indentures, to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2 and to pay the fees and expenses relating to the Merger and the Financing. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) a fully executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (including all exhibits thereto in effect on the date hereof) and (ii) the executed fee letter referenced therein, relating to fees with respect to the Financing contemplated by the</text>

Pursuant to the Commitment Letter, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the Financing Sources party thereto have committed to provide Parent with the amounts set forth in the Commitment Letter for the purposes set forth therein (the debt financing contemplated in the Commitment Letter, together with, unless the context otherwise requires, any replacement financing, including any bank financing or debt securities issued in lieu thereof, the “Financing”). As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated, or otherwise amended or modified in any respect and no amendment or modification is contemplated (other than as set forth in the fee letters with respect to flex rights and/or to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents and similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement), and the Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of, and is enforceable against, Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, subject, in each case, to the Enforceability Exceptions. Except as set forth in the Commitment Letter and except for any related commitment letters, engagement letters and fee letters related to the permanent financing described in the Commitment Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no contracts, agreements, “side letters” or other arrangements to which Parent or any of its affiliates is a party relating to the Commitment Letter or the Financing.</text>
        <text>(b) As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to constitute, a default or breach by Parent or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, of any term of the Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, no Financing Source party to the Commitment Letter has notified Parent of its termination or repudiation (or intent to terminate or repudiate) any of the commitments under such Commitment Letter or intent not to provide the Financing. Assuming the truth and accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties set forth in Article III and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder, in each case, in all material respects, and assuming satisfaction of the conditions in Article VII (other than the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) and those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the funding of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter and contained in the Commitment Letter will fail to be satisfied on the Closing Date or that the full amounts committed pursuant to the Commitment Letter will not be available to be funded on the Closing Date to the extent required, when taken together with cash or cash equivalents held by Parent and the Company on the Closing Date and the other sources of funds available to Parent on the Closing Date, to refinance in full all amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement, the Company Receivables Financing Agreement and the Company Indentures, to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2 and to pay the fees and expenses relating to the Merger and the Financing.</text>

        <text>(d) Parent has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. Assuming (i) the funding of the full amount of the Financing in accordance with and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in the Commitment Letter, (ii) the truth and accuracy of the Company’s representations and warranties set forth in Article III and compliance by the Company with its obligations hereunder, in each case, in all material respects, and (iii) satisfaction of the conditions in Article VII, the aggregate proceeds from the Financing (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue discount and similar premiums and chargers and after giving effect of the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount flex) provided under the Commitment Letter) constitute all of the financing necessary to refinance in full all amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement, the Company Receivables Financing Agreement and the Company Indentures, to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2 and to pay the fees and expenses relating to the Merger and the Financing and, when taken together with cash or cash equivalents held by Parent and the Company on the Closing Date and the other sources of funds available to Parent on the Closing Date, will be sufficient in amount to pay the foregoing amounts in full. The only conditions precedent related to the obligations of the Financing Sources party to the Commitment Letter to fund the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter are expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter.</text>

Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with the other party’s regular business operations during any such access. None of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to properties, books, contracts, personnel, information technology systems and records, or to disclose information, pursuant to this Section 6.2, where such access or disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of Parent or the Company, violate or prejudice the rights of Parent’s or the Company’s customers, result in the disclosure of trade secrets of any third parties or competitively sensitive information, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the party in possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the parties), unreasonably interfere with the other party’s regular business operations during any such access or contravene any Law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. In the event that either party withholds information on the basis of the foregoing, such party shall inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being withheld, and the parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply so that such disclosure does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments, including through (i) use of commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the required consent or waiver of any third party required to provide such information and (ii) the implementation of appropriate and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information in a matter so as to remove the basis for objection, including by arrangement of appropriate “clean room” procedures, redaction or entry into a customary joint defense agreement with respect to any information to be so provided if the parties determine that so doing would reasonably permit the disclosure of such information without violating applicable Law or jeopardizing any attorney-client privilege.</text>
        <text>(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party’s Subsidiaries or Representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated November 7, 2018, between Parent and the Company (the “Confidentiality Agreement”).</text>

Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries’ respective operations.</text>

Parent shall not postpone the Parent Meeting except to the extent required by Law or in accordance with the remaining provisions of this Section 6.3(a). Parent agrees (i) to provide the Company with reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on a timely basis (including, if requested, promptly providing daily voting reports in the last ten (10) days prior to the Parent Meeting) and (ii) to give written notice (which, for the avoidance of doubt, may be given via e-mail) to the Company one (1) day prior to, and on the date of, the Parent Meeting, indicating whether, as of such date, sufficient proxies representing the Requisite Parent Vote have been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on a date that is two (2) business days prior to the time for which the Parent Meeting was originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Statement) (the “Original Parent Meeting Date”), (A) Parent has not received proxies representing the Requisite Parent Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, (B) there are insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) and voting to approve the Parent Share Issuance to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Meeting, or (C) it is necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Joint Statement is required to be delivered, Parent may, or, if the Company so requests, shall, postpone or adjourn the Parent Meeting; provided that Parent shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the Parent Meeting two (2) times. In the event of any postponement or adjournment of the Parent Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.3(a), Parent has the sole discretion to set the date for the postponement or adjournment of the Parent Meeting; provided that the Parent Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10) business days from the Original Parent Meeting Date in connection with the first (1st) postponement or adjournment or more than an aggregate of thirty (30) business days from the Original Parent Meeting Date if the Parent Meeting is postponed or adjourned for two (2) times.

As soon as reasonably practicable after obtaining the Requisite Company Vote as contemplated in this Section 6.3(b), the Company shall prepare (subject to reasonable approval of Parent) and deliver to its stockholders who have not consented the notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL. For the avoidance of doubt, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms or Parent has made a Company Meeting Election, the Company Consent Solicitation shall be conducted and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption via written consent, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.</text>

In the event of any postponement or adjournment of the Company Meeting pursuant to this Section 6.3(c), the Company has the sole discretion to set the date for the postponement or adjournment of the Company Meeting; provided that the Company Meeting shall not be postponed or adjourned by more than ten (10) business days from the Original Company Meeting Date in connection with the first (1st) postponement or adjournment or more than an aggregate of thirty (30) business days from the Original Company Meeting Date if the Company Meeting Date is postponed or adjourned for two (2) times. If the Company Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained, either Parent or the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e). For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent has made a Company Meeting Election, but subject to the Company’s right or Parent’s right to request the Company to adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting permitted in this Section 6.3(c), unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for approval at the Company Meeting, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation.</text>

Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3, except that references to “four (4) business days” shall be deemed to be references to “two (2) business days.”</text>

Without limiting the foregoing, during the two (2)-year period commencing on the Closing Date, Parent or its applicable Subsidiary shall continue to maintain, without amendment thereto, the Company Benefit Plans providing severance benefits as set forth in Section 6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.</text>

The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the Company 401(k) Plan has been terminated or amended, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 6.5(c); provided that prior to amending or terminating the Company 401(k) Plan, the Company shall provide the form and substance of any applicable resolutions or amendments to Parent for review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).</text>

        <text>(b) Subject to the following sentence, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and fully pay the premium for “tail” insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors’ and officers’ liability coverage of the Company’s existing directors’ and officers’ insurance policies and (ii) the Company’s existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case, for a claims reporting or discovery period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (the “Tail Period”) from one (1) or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Company’s insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the insureds as the Company’s existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the Merger); provided, however, that Parent shall not be obligated to expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of three-hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the “Premium Cap”), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed the Premium Cap, then Parent shall cause to be maintained, in Parent’s good faith determination, policies of insurance that provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of, Parent, may (and, at the request of Parent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to) obtain at or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year “tail” policy under the Company’s existing directors and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium Cap.</text>

In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.</text>
        <text>(e) During the Tail Period, all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Company Indemnified Party as provided in the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or any organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification agreement between such Company Indemnified Party and the Company or a Company Subsidiary, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Effective Time unchanged and shall not be amended, restated, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Company Indemnified Party.</text>
