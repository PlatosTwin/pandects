        <text>At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the holders thereof:</text>
        <text>(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 1.2(b) or Section 1.4, and subject to Section 1.3, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to receive $5.50 in cash, without interest (such amount, as may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.9 of this Agreement, the “Merger Consideration”), and any holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 1.2(a);</text>

      <section title="Section 1.3 Surrender and Payment." order="3" standardId="31bbaa44a6c19c5d">
        <text>(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the “Payment Agent”) for the purpose of acting as the payment agent in the Merger. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit and make available to the Payment Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of (i) the certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the “Certificates”) and (ii) the uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the “Uncertificated Shares”) (but not any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Option Merger Consideration, the Company RSU Merger Consideration or the Company Restricted Share Merger Consideration) (the “Payment Fund”). If for any reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under Section 1.3(b), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit (or cause to be deposited) in trust additional cash with the Payment Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement (but not any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Option Merger Consideration, the Company RSU Merger Consideration or the Company Restricted Share Merger Consideration). All cash deposited with the Payment Agent shall only be used for the purposes provided in this Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent before the Effective Time. Any income from investment of the Payment Fund will be payable to the Surviving Corporation. Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to send to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time (other than the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any other Subsidiary of Parent, any Company Subsidiary, or holders of Dissenting Shares who have not subsequently withdrawn or lost their rights of appraisal), whether represented by Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, a letter of transmittal, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation, and</text>

        <text>(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to and in accordance with Section 1.3(a) shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an “agent’s message” by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share; provided, that receipt of an “agent’s message” shall be deemed to be an express acknowledgement that the holder of such Uncertificated Shares has received and agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal (and shall be deemed to have delivered an executed copy thereof). Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration, and any holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.2(a). No interest or dividends will be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.</text>
        <text>(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay in advance to the Payment Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.</text>
        <text>(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article I.</text>
        <text>(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Payment Agent pursuant to Section 1.3(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and thereafter any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 1.3 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company</text>

Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or, if earlier, immediately prior to such time when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.</text>
        <text>(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Payment Agent pursuant to Section 1.4 in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.</text>

The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under the DGCL consistent with the obligations of the Company thereunder. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent.</text>

        <text>(iv) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors) that failure to take such action to effect a Change of Recommendation would continue to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law (taking into account any revisions to this Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent prior to the time of such determination pursuant to Section 5.3(e)(iii)); and</text>
        <text>(v) in the event of a termination of this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 and paid any Company Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.4.</text>

        <text>(g) Existing Discussions. Upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company agrees that it shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) cease providing any information to any such Person or its Representatives and terminate all access granted to any such Person and its Representatives to any physical or electronic data room and (iii) request that any such Person and its Representatives promptly return to the Company or destroy any non-public information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries that was previously furnished or made available to such Person or any of its Representatives by or on behalf of the Company or its Representatives in accordance with the terms of the confidentiality agreement in place with such Person.</text>
        <text>(h) Breach By Representatives. The Company agrees that any material breach of this Section 5.3 by any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the Company.</text>

        <text>(c) The Company shall use commercially reasonably efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is first filed with the SEC.

        <text>(d) The Company shall, in consultation with Parent, establish a record date (that is as early as reasonably practicable and in compliance with applicable Law) for purposes of determining the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to notice of and vote at the Stockholders Meeting (the “Record Date”). Once the Company has established the Record Date, the Company shall not change such Record Date or establish a different record date for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law. In the event that the date of the Stockholders Meeting as originally called is adjourned, postponed or otherwise delayed in accordance with Section 5.4(b), the Company agrees that, unless Parent shall have otherwise approved in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall implement such adjournment, postponement or other delay in such a way that the Company does not establish a new Record Date for the Stockholders Meeting, as so adjourned, postponed or delayed, except as may be required by applicable Law.</text>

The obligations set forth in this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the D&amp;O Insurance or the “tail” policy referred to in Section 5.9(c) (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other</text>
