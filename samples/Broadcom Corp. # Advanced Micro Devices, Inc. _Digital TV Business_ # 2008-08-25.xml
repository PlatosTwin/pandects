In addition, Seller may retain copies of the relevant Technology elements of the Purchased IP Assets solely for purposes of enabling Seller and its Subsidiaries to exercise their license rights pursuant to the Intellectual Property License Agreements. In addition, to the extent that Purchaser received a copy, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take such further action as may be reasonably necessary to deliver copies of the Technology elements of the Purchased IP Assets to Seller and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates for purposes of enabling Seller and its Subsidiaries to exercise their license rights pursuant to the Intellectual Property License Agreements.</text>

Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of its relevant Subsidiaries to, diligently and expeditiously take such action as is necessary or advisable to obtain such consents as promptly as reasonably practicable; provided, however, that all costs and expenses (other than costs and expenses of Seller’s legal counsel) of obtaining any such consent, including consents or renegotiations of any other Contract, Permit (including any Environmental Permit), Approval, certificate, authorization or other right constituting a consent required by Section 6.3(d) or other arrangement that the Parties mutually agree shall be delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the responsibility of Purchaser (it being understood and agreed that nothing herein shall require Purchaser, in connection with any such required consent or arrangement, (i) to pay or assume responsibility for any unreasonable cost or expense or (ii) agree to additional terms and conditions that are adverse to Purchaser in any material respect, in each case in connection with the applicable Contract, Permit, Approval, or other instrument to which such required consent relates). To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law and the terms of the Nonassignable Assets, in the event any such consents to assignment cannot be obtained, such Nonassignable Assets shall be held, from and after the Closing, by Seller and its Subsidiaries in trust for Purchaser and the covenants and obligations thereunder shall be performed by Purchaser in the name of Seller and its Subsidiaries and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be for Purchaser’s account. Seller and its Subsidiaries shall take or cause to be taken at Purchaser’s expense such actions in its name or otherwise as Purchaser may reasonably request so as to provide Purchaser with the benefits of the Nonassignable Assets and to effect collection of money or other consideration that becomes due and payable under the Nonassignable Assets, and Seller and its Subsidiaries shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all money or other consideration received by any of them in respect of all Nonassignable Assets. From and after the Closing, Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, authorizes Purchaser, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of the Nonassignable Assets, at Purchaser’s expense, to perform all the obligations and receive all the benefits of Seller and its Subsidiaries under the Nonassignable Assets. If after the Closing any Nonassignable Asset becomes assignable (either because consent for the assignment thereof is obtained or otherwise), Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser and transfer and assign such previously Nonassignable Asset to Purchaser or a Subsidiary of Purchaser, as Purchaser shall designate.</text>

        <text>(a) Continuing Employees. Except in the case of EU Transferring Employees, Purchaser shall have the right to recruit, make offers of post-Closing employment with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to, and to employ (or cause a Subsidiary of Purchaser to employ) (following the Closing) such Business Employees as Purchaser shall designate in their sole discretion, and Seller shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) cooperate with and facilitate Purchaser’s review of and contacts with Business Employees for possible post-Closing employment; provided, that Purchaser shall make offers of post-Closing employment to substantially all (which in no event shall be less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the employees identified or described in Schedule 5.7(a)). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) (i) provide Purchaser and its Representatives with access to Business Employees who wish to meet with Purchaser during normal business hours for the purpose of conducting meetings and interviews and (ii) provide prompt written notice to Purchaser of any Business Employees who notify Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that such Business Employee (A) intends to terminate, or terminates, his or her employment with Seller or its Subsidiaries (as applicable) except in connection with such employee’s acceptance of employment with Purchaser or its Subsidiaries (as applicable) or (B) intends to not accept</text>

        <text>Purchaser’s offer of employment or intends to accept Purchaser’s offer of employment and subsequently terminate such employment after the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, any personal information (as defined by applicable privacy Laws) about Business Employees which is disclosed to Purchaser by Seller for the purposes contemplated in this Section 5.7(a) or for any other purposes contemplated by this Agreement, shall be held by Purchaser in strict confidence and shall not be used, disclosed or retained by Purchaser for any other purposes, and shall otherwise be handled by Purchaser in compliance with applicable privacy Laws. Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and in any event no later than seven (7) calendar days (or such longer period as may be required by applicable Law) prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver, in writing, an offer of employment to the Business Employees identified or described in Schedule 5.7(a), such employment to commence on the day immediately following the Closing, subject to Purchaser’s standard conditions for employees in each applicable jurisdiction (the employees accepting such offers of employment, together with the EU Continuing Employees, being referred to herein as the “Continuing Employees”). The terms offered to each such Business Employee will be on terms that are not less favorable, in the aggregate, for each such Business Employee, than the terms applicable to such employee summarized in a confidential letter delivered by Purchaser to Seller concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, it being understood that the content of such letter shall be subject to applicable privacy Laws and shall be kept strictly confidential by Seller. Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a preliminary schedule of the names of the Continuing Employees, to the extent then known by Purchaser, no later than two (2) calendar days prior to the Closing, and a revised final schedule of the names of the Continuing Employees promptly following the Closing. Such offers will, where permitted by Law, be on an “at will” basis and otherwise will offer compensation packages commensurate with each Continuing Employee’s experience and proposed title and position with Purchaser. Purchaser and Seller shall abide by any local or country-specific notification or consultation requirements with respect to Continuing Employees and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable Business Employees to accept such offers and to consent to any changes in terms of employment. Seller shall provide Purchaser with reasonable advance notice of any proposed written communication to or with Continuing Employees regarding the effects of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Continuing Employees and reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such communications. Seller hereby consents to the hiring by Purchaser or a Subsidiary of Purchaser of the Continuing Employees and waives, with respect to the employment by Purchaser or a Subsidiary of Purchaser of the Continuing Employees, any claims or rights that Seller or any Subsidiary may have against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, against any of its or their Representatives or against any Continuing Employee hired by Purchaser under any non-competition, confidentiality or employment agreement, or otherwise under any applicable Law, as a result of Purchaser’s employment of such Continuing Employee; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not constitute a waiver of any claim or right that Seller or any of its Subsidiaries may have against any such Continuing Employee under any such confidentiality agreement, or against Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or their Representatives pursuant to the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, as a result of the unauthorized disclosure (in violation of such agreement) of confidential information not related to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities.</text>

        <text>(b) Excluded Employees. Any Business Employee who is not offered employment by Purchaser prior to Closing or who does not accept an offer of employment by Purchaser, in each case pursuant to Section 5.7(a), and who is not an EU Transferring Employee, is hereinafter referred to as a “Non-transferring Employee.” Seller shall indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless with respect to all Liabilities relating to any Non-transferring Employee, including, (i) any employment-related liability, (ii) any liability relating to, arising under or in connection with any Seller Benefit Plan, including any liability under COBRA, whether arising prior to, on or after the Closing Date, and (iii) any liability under WARN or similar applicable state, local or foreign Laws. Purchaser shall have no liability or responsibility with respect to any Non-transferring Employee. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no liability for any severance payment that any Non-transferring Employee may be entitled to receive in the event of termination of such individual’s employment with Seller or any Seller’s Subsidiaries.</text>
        <text>(c) Termination of Certain Employees. Prior to the Effective Time, and except in the case of EU Transferring Employees, Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts (i) to obtain the voluntary consent of a Continuing Employee to resign his or her employment from Seller (or the applicable Subsidiary of Seller) and to become employed by Purchaser (or the applicable Subsidiary of Purchaser) or (ii) to obtain the voluntary consent of a Continuing Employee to transfer his or her employment to Purchaser (or the applicable Subsidiary of Purchaser) or (iii) to enter into an agreement with a Continuing Employee by which Purchaser assumes the material provisions of such Continuing Employee’s employment agreement, the determination of which shall be established by Seller and Purchaser based on applicable local Laws and standard local practice to minimize severance payments upon the transfer of or resignation and immediate rehiring of Continuing Employees, as applicable, on the Closing Date. With respect to Business Employees located in jurisdictions where local employment Laws may be argued to provide for an automatic transfer of such Business Employees’ employment to Purchaser upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or to provide such Business Employees with a right to continuation of employment or to continuation of current compensation and benefits, excluding EU Transferring Employees, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure such resignations, waivers, releases and agreements as may be required to permit the employment by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries of the Business Employees listed in Schedule 5.7(a) (and no other employees of Seller and its Subsidiaries) and their employment by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries on the terms offered by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries. Subject to applicable Laws, on and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have the right to dismiss any or all Continuing Employees at any time, with or without cause, and to change the terms and conditions of their employment (including compensation and employee benefits provided to them).</text>
        <text>(d) Employee Benefits.</text>
        <text>(i) Accrued Vacation. Purchaser shall give each Continuing Employee credit for years of service with Seller for purposes of calculating such Continuing Employee’s vacation accrual rate with Purchaser. For Continuing Employees located in all jurisdictions other than India, the United States, and the United Kingdom, Purchaser shall permit</text>

        <pageUUID>47adfb52-4a0d-11f0-8d00-be44a5e954c9</pageUUID>
        <text>each Continuing Employee to carry over to Purchaser any vacation time accrued but unused with Seller, up to a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of such Continuing Employee’s annual vacation accrual rate with Purchaser, and Seller shall pay to such Continuing Employee the remainder of any accrued but unused vacation time. For Continuing Employees located in India, on the Closing Date Seller shall pay each Continuing Employee for all accrued but unused vacation time through the Closing Date. For Continuing Employees located in the United States, on the Closing Date Seller shall pay each Continuing Employee for all accrued but unused vacation time through the Closing Date, unless the Continuing Employee consents to the partial payout and carryover described in the first sentence of this Section 5.7(d)(i). For Continuing Employees located in the United Kingdom, all Continuing Employees shall carry over to Purchaser all accrued and unused vacation time in accordance with applicable Law. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the value of all vacation time carried over by Continuing Employees to Purchaser, calculated on the basis of each Continuing Employee’s base compensation rate as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (or on such other basis, if higher, as Seller actually uses in calculating the payments it makes or is required to make to Continuing Employees pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.7(d)(i)). At least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate of Seller’s chief financial officer setting forth the amount of vacation time that will have accrued through (and including) the Closing Date for each Business Employee, the dollar amount of each such employee’s salary (or hourly wage rate), and the resulting value of each such employee’s accrued vacation time.</text>
        <text>(ii) Vesting of Seller Employee Benefit Plan Benefits. Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the tax-qualified pension and 401(k) plans in which Continuing Employees were eligible to participate immediately prior to the Closing Date to fully vest such employees’ accrued benefit through the Closing Date thereunder.</text>
        <text>(iii) Bonuses. For Continuing Employees located in China and Taiwan who are eligible (pursuant to their existing employment terms) to receive a bonus equal to one (1) month or two (2) months (as applicable) of such Continuing Employee’s salary (the “Month Bonus”), in lieu of Seller paying the accrued and unpaid amount of such Month Bonus as of the Closing Date (the “Accrued Bonus Amount”) on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall carry over the Accrued Bonus Amount and pay the applicable Accrued Bonus Amount to the Continuing Employee in accordance with such Continuing Employee’s existing employment terms. The Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate Accrued Bonus Amount for all applicable Continuing Employees. At least two (2) Business Days before the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a certificate of Seller’s chief financial officer setting forth the aggregate amount of the Accrued Bonus Amount for each Continuing Employee.</text>
        <text>(e) EU Business Employees.</text>
        <text>(i) The provisions of Sections 5.7(a), (b) and (c), with the exception of the definition of “Continuing Employees” insofar as it is used in any other sections of this Agreement, shall not apply to EU Transferring Employees.</text>

        <text>(ii) Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that the contracts of employment between Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries, and each of the EU Transferring Employees shall have effect from the Effective Time as if originally made between Purchaser, or one of its designated Affiliates, and the applicable EU Business Employee pursuant to the operation of the EU Transfer Regulations in the applicable Member State in relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.</text>
        <text>(iii) In the event that the contract of employment between Seller, or any of its Subsidiaries, and any UK Employee does not have effect from the Effective Time as if originally made between Purchaser or one of its designated Affiliates, and the applicable UK Employee pursuant to the operation of the EU Transfer Regulations in the United Kingdom in relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the provisions of Sections 5.7(a), (b), (c) and (d) shall apply in relation to those UK Employees whose contracts of employment do not transfer, provided that the various time limits stated in Sections 5.7(a), (b), (c), and (d) shall not apply and each Party shall be obliged to use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with its respective obligations without any unreasonable delay following that Party becoming aware that the contract of employment of the relevant UK Employee did not transfer pursuant to the operation of the EU Transfer Regulations in the UK at the Effective Time.</text>
        <text>(iv) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this Section 5.7(e), with regard to the French EU Business Employee, Purchaser (or its appropriate Subsidiary) shall offer to such French EU Business Employee equivalent contractual terms and conditions of employment as those enjoyed by such French EU Business Employee immediately before such offer is made. Such offer shall be valid for at least six (6) weeks. Purchaser (or its appropriate Subsidiary) shall present the offer simultaneously to the French EU Business Employee and Seller.</text>
        <text>(v) If the contract of employment of any person who is employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates or by any contractor, sub-contractor or agent of Seller or any of its Affiliates in the United Kingdom, but who is not a UK Employee, has effect as if originally made between Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and the applicable person pursuant to the operation of the EU Transfer Regulations in the United Kingdom in relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser (or the applicable Affiliate of Purchaser) may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of becoming aware of such effect, terminate the contract of employment of each such relevant person. If: (A) Purchaser (or an Affiliate of Purchaser) has notified Seller in advance of the dismissal, (B) Purchaser (or the applicable Affiliate of Purchaser) has used reasonable endeavors to comply with the three-step dismissal procedure set out in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Employment Act 2002, (C) the dismissal is not by reason of, or connected to, a form of discrimination prohibited by law in the United Kingdom, and (D) the dismissal occurs within the stated fourteen (14) calendar day period, even if the dismissal procedure referred to above has not been completed by that stage, then Seller agrees to indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates against any and all Liabilities and Losses arising from, or connected with, any and all such terminations and against any and all reasonable sums payable to, or in respect of, the applicable person in respect of his employment up to, and including, the date upon which his employment is so terminated.</text>

        <text>(i) On each of the first, second and third year anniversaries of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a complete and accurate list of (A) each Continuing Employee who is entitled to severance due to a termination of employment with Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser that occurs during the twelve (12), twenty-four (24) and thirty-six (36) months, respectively, following the Closing Date (“Terminated Continuing Employee”), (B) the total severance amount paid or due to each Terminated Continuing Employee, (C) the portion of the total severance amount paid or due to each Terminated Continuing Employee for which Seller is responsible in accordance with Section 1.4(b) and this Section 5.7(g) (provided, however, that with regard to severance due to a termination of employment with Purchaser prior to the last day of the eighteenth (18th) month following the Closing Date, such portion of the total severance amount shall not be more than the severance that such Terminated Continuing Employee would have received if such Terminated Continuing Employee’s employment was terminated immediately prior to the Closing Date; and provided, further, that with regard to severance due to a termination of employment with Purchaser after the eighteenth (18th) month following the Closing Date but on or prior to the last day of the thirty-sixth (36th) month following the Closing Date, such portion of the total severance amount shall not total more than eight million dollars ($8,000,000)), (D) the underlying calculations of the amounts under clauses (B) and (C), and (E) a summary description of the reason that severance is payable (“Severance Liability List”). For purposes of this Section 5.7(g), Seller shall be responsible to Purchaser for an amount equal to the product of (i) the total severance amount paid or due to each Terminated Continuing Employee, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months that such Terminated Continuing Employee was employed by Seller, and the denominator of which is the total number of months that such Terminated Continuing Employee was employed by Seller (and/or a Subsidiary of Seller) and Purchaser (and/or a Subsidiary of Purchaser). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, Seller shall be responsible for severance of Terminated Continuing Employees solely under the terms of (and shall not exceed the amounts payable under) Seller’s severance plans and programs in existence as of the Closing Date and under statutory severance obligations in existence as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in determining the amount of severance for which Seller shall be responsible, the amount of severance payable to Terminated Continuing Employees shall be calculated as if such severance were payable pursuant to the severance plans of Seller and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof (or, if greater, on the Closing Date) and under severance statutes as in effect as of the Closing Date.</text>
        <text>(ii) As soon as practicable, Seller shall review and confirm the accuracy of the Severance Liability List. If Seller disputes the accuracy of the Severance Liability List, Seller shall deliver a written notice (“Severance Liability List Dispute Notice”) to Purchaser before 5 p.m. Pacific Time on the thirtieth (30th) day after the delivery of the Severance Liability List (“Severance Liability List Review Period”).</text>

        <text>(iii) If Seller delivers a Severance Liability List Dispute Notice to Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Severance Liability List Review Period, then Seller and Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the accuracy of the Severance Liability List. If Seller and Purchaser are unable to reach agreement on the accuracy of the Severance Liability List within twenty (20) days after the expiration of the Severance Liability List Review Period, either Seller or Purchaser may demand arbitration of the dispute. The dispute shall be resolved by three (3) arbitrators, one selected by Seller, one selected by Purchaser, and the third selected jointly by the two arbitrators previously selected by Seller and Purchaser. The decision of a majority of the three (3) arbitrators as to the accuracy of the Severance Liability List shall be binding and conclusive upon Seller and Purchaser. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the dispute which shall set forth the judgment of the arbitrators.</text>
        <text>(iv) Judgment to enforce the decision rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in a location within the Northern District of California under the commercial rules of arbitration then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. Each Party shall pay its own expenses, including attorneys’ fees. The expenses and fees of each arbitrator and the administrative costs of the arbitration and the expenses shall be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser.</text>
        <text>(h) No Third-Party Beneficiary Rights. No provision of this Section 5.7 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Business Employee, or any beneficiary or dependents thereof, including the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee or under any employee benefit plan which Purchaser may maintain.</text>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to acquire a majority equity or other majority ownership interest of a Person whose principal line of business is not a Restricted Business, but which has a division or other operations constituting a Restricted Business (any such division or operations, an “Acquired Competing Interest”), provided that (i) the annual gross sales or revenues from such Restricted Business do not exceed twenty five million dollars ($25,000,000) and in any event such gross sales or revenues from such Restricted Business do not exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the total annual gross sales or revenues of such Person for the last completed fiscal year of such Person, and (ii) Seller shall or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to take all commercially reasonable steps to sell or otherwise divest the Acquired Competing Interest as soon as reasonably practicable to an unaffiliated Person; and provided further that if Seller and its Subsidiaries have not completed the sale or other divestiture of the Acquired Competing Interest within six (6) months after the acquisition by Seller and its Subsidiaries of the Acquired Competing Interest, then Seller shall immediately cause the operations of the Acquired Competing Interest to be ceased. The parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing will be inadequate and that Purchaser, in addition to any other relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever.</text>

        <text>(iv) To the extent that any Loss that is the subject of a claim for indemnification under this Article 7 is compensated by insurance proceeds paid to an Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 7 only with respect to the amount of Losses that are in excess of the cash proceeds received by such Indemnified Party pursuant to such insurance, after deducting therefrom the expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in obtaining such proceeds and the amount of any increase in premiums payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of the claims made against such insurance in relation to such matter (“Net Insurance Proceeds”). If such Indemnified Party receives such cash insurance proceeds prior to the time such claim is paid, then the amount payable by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to such claim shall be reduced by the amount of such Net Insurance Proceeds. If such Indemnified Party receives such cash insurance proceeds after such claim is paid, then upon receipt by such Indemnified Party of any cash proceeds pursuant to such insurance with respect to such claim, such Indemnified Party shall repay any portion of such Net Insurance Proceeds which was previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to such the Indemnified Party in satisfaction of such claim.</text>

        <text>inaccuracies in, the representations and warranties of the Indemnifying Party in this Agreement; provided, that nothing in this Section 7.2(c) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall affect the parties’ rights to specific performance or other equitable remedies with respect to the covenants and agreements in this Agreement, the Intellectual Property License Agreements or any of the other Ancillary Agreements or that are to be performed at or after the Closing, and nothing in this Section 7.2(c) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to limit Seller’s responsibilities, obligations or liabilities in respect of the Retained Liabilities or Excluded Assets, or Purchaser’s responsibilities, obligations and liabilities in respect of Assumed Liabilities, or either Party’s responsibilities, obligations and liabilities in respect of its respective covenants, agreements and obligations (whether in this Agreement, in the Intellectual Property License Agreements or in the Transition Services Agreement (except, in the case of the Transition Services Agreement, as set forth in Section 7.2(c)(ii))) to be performed at or after the Closing (each an “Excepted Matter” and collectively, the “Excepted Matters”).</text>
        <text>(d) Escrow Period; Distribution of Escrow Fund upon Termination of Escrow Period. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the Expiration Date (the period of time from the Effective Time through and including 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the Expiration Date is referred to herein as the “Escrow Period”), and all property thereafter remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed as set forth in the last sentence of this Section 7.2(d); provided, however, that the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to such amount as may be necessary in the good faith judgment of Purchaser, subject to the objection of Seller and the subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner as provided in Section 7.2(h), to satisfy any unsatisfied claims under this Section 7.2 concerning facts and circumstances existing prior to the termination of the Escrow Period which claims are specified in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of the Escrow Period. Promptly after all such claims, if any, have been resolved, Purchaser and Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not required to satisfy such claims.</text>
        <text>(e) Protection of Escrow Fund; Interest Income.</text>
        <text>(i) Purchaser and Seller shall require the Escrow Agent to hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, to treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and to hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be invested only in obligations of (or guaranteed by) the U.S. Government as to principal and interest, or such other investments as Purchaser and Seller shall direct in joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent. Purchaser and Seller agree that in no event shall the Escrow Agent have any liability under the Escrow Agreement for investment losses incurred on any investment or reinvestment made in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller agree that the Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any market loss on any investment liquidated prior to maturity in order to make a payment required hereunder.</text>

        <text>(ii) All income derived from the investment of the Escrow Fund (the “Investment Income”) shall be deemed for Tax purposes to constitute (and shall be reported as) income of Seller. Such Investment Income shall be deemed part of the Escrow Fund, subject to claims for indemnification and distributions to Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with this Article 7; provided, however, that Purchaser and Seller agree that twenty percent (20%) of the amount of such Investment Income in each calendar quarter shall automatically be deducted from such income and paid as a distribution by the Escrow Agent to Seller out of the Escrow Fund on the last day of each calendar quarter, without regard to the procedures of Section 7.2(f), (g), or (h). Except for the Investment Income, unless and until distributed to Seller (and then only to the extent distributed to Seller), the Parties agree to treat the Escrow Fund as owned by Purchaser and not received by Seller and to file all Tax Returns on a basis consistent with such treatment.</text>
        <text>(f) Claims for Indemnification; Claims Upon Escrow Fund. Claims for indemnification shall be made by delivery of a certificate signed by any officer of the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party (an “Officer’s Certificate”). Each Officer’s Certificate: (i) shall state, in substance, that the Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, sustained and/or accrued (or, in the case of indemnification claims involving anticipated Losses, that the Indemnified Party anticipates in good faith that it will pay, incur, sustain and/or accrue) Losses, directly or indirectly, as a result of (A) any breach or violation of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty (either as made on the date hereof or as if made on and as of the Closing Date, other than representations and warranties that by their express terms are made solely as of a specified earlier date, as to which the Officer’s Certificate shall state that the Losses are a result of a breach, violation or inaccuracy as of such specified earlier date), or any breach or violation of any covenant or agreement, made by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate, agreement or instrument delivered by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party in connection herewith or therewith, or any claim by any third party alleging, constituting or involving such a breach, violation or inaccuracy, (B) any of the Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities (in the case of indemnification claims by Purchaser related thereto) or any of the Assumed Liabilities (in the case of indemnification claims by Seller related thereto), (C) any other matter for which an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (including, in the case of Purchaser, Sections 1.8, 5.5, 5.6 or 5.7), or (D) any matter referred to in Schedule 7.2(b)(iv); and (ii) shall specify in reasonable detail the individual items of Loss included in the amount so stated, the date (if known) when each such item of Loss was paid, incurred, sustained and/or accrued (or, in the case of anticipated Losses, the basis for such anticipated Loss), and the general nature of the representation, warranty, agreement, covenant, Excluded Asset, Retained Liability, Assumed Liability, or other matter to which such item of Loss or anticipated Loss is related.</text>
        <text>(g) Objections to Claims. A copy of the Officer’s Certificate shall be delivered to the Indemnifying Party and, in the case of indemnification claims involving a claim against the Escrow Fund, to the Escrow Agent. The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of an Officer’s Certificate in which to object, in whole or in part, to the indemnification claim(s) set forth in the Officer’s Certificate. Objection shall be made by a</text>

        <pageUUID>47aea2be-4a0d-11f0-8d00-be44a5e954c9</pageUUID>
        <text>certificate in writing, signed by an officer of the Indemnifying Party, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for objection, which shall be delivered to the Indemnified Party (and, the case of indemnification claims involving a claim against the Escrow Fund, to the Escrow Agent) prior to 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the last day of such twenty (20) Business Day period. In the case of indemnification claims involving a claim against the Escrow Fund, if compliant objection in writing is made and timely delivered in accordance with the requirements of this Section 7.2(g), Purchaser and Seller agree that the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to the Indemnified Party of any portion of the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 7.2(d) unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization from the Indemnifying Party to make such delivery. If compliant objection in writing is not made or is not timely delivered in accordance with the requirements of this Section 7.2(g), Purchaser and Seller shall require the Escrow Agent, as promptly as practicable following the expiration of such twenty (20) Business Day period, to pay to the Indemnified Party, from the Escrow Fund, an amount in cash equal to the amount of Losses claimed against the Escrow Fund in the Officer’s Certificate, in accordance with Section 7.2(f); provided, that where the basis for a claim is that the Indemnified Party anticipates that it will pay, incur, sustain and/or accrue a Loss, no payment will be made from the Escrow Fund for such Loss unless and until such Loss is actually paid, incurred, sustained and/or accrued.</text>
        <text>(h) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.</text>
        <text>(i) If the Indemnifying Party has objected in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer’s Certificate in accordance with the procedures of Section 7.2(g), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of indemnification claims involving a claim against the Escrow Fund, a copy thereof shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. Purchaser and Seller agree that the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and to distribute funds from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.</text>
        <text>(ii) If no such agreement is reached after good-faith negotiations, the Indemnified Party (or, in the case of indemnification claims involving a claim against the Escrow Fund, either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party) may demand arbitration of the dispute. If the amount of the Loss is at issue in a pending Action or Proceeding involving a Third-Party Claim (as defined in Section 7.2(i)), arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is determined in such Action or Proceeding (whether by verdict, judgment, finding of fact, settlement or other order, stipulation or agreement) or otherwise ascertained, or both parties agree to arbitration. Any dispute regarding a claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article 7 that is reasonably expected to require, for its determination, the application or determination of a substantive issue of patent law, shall, at the request of either Party, be resolved by special confidential arbitration pursuant to the rules set forth in Schedule 7.2(h)(ii). Otherwise, the dispute shall be resolved by three arbitrators, one selected by the Indemnified Party, one selected by the Indemnifying Party, and the third selected jointly by the two arbitrators previously selected by the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, in accordance with the following provisions and procedures:</text>
        <page>67</page>
        <pageUUID>47aea714-4a0d-11f0-8d00-be44a5e954c9</pageUUID>
        <text>(A) The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery of information relating to any dispute while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate as determined in the sole judgment of the arbitrators, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute.</text>
        <text>(B) The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel, limit or allow discovery as they shall deem appropriate given the nature and extent of the disputed claim. The arbitrators shall also have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys’ fees and other costs incurred by the parties, to the same extent as a court of law or equity, if the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to by a Party without substantial justification.</text>
        <text>(C) The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officer’s Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and (in the case of indemnification claims involving a claim against the Escrow Fund), notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2(g), Purchaser and Seller agree that the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the dispute which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order of the arbitrators.</text>
        <text>(D) Judgment upon any award, judgment, decree or order rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in a location within the Northern District of California under the commercial rules of arbitration then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. For purposes of this Section 7.2(h), in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in the Officer’s Certificate is at issue, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party if the arbitrators award the Indemnified Party less than one-half of the disputed amount of claimed Losses (exclusive of any amounts not in dispute); otherwise, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the arbitration and the expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, incurred by the other Party to the arbitration.</text>
        <text>(iii) Confidentiality. In connection with indemnification and arbitration matters pursuant to this Article 7 (including pursuant to Schedule 7.2(h)(ii)), each Party and its Representatives shall hold in strict confidence, shall not use for any purpose other than as permitted under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and shall not disclose to any Person, any nonpublic information from or concerning the other Party, concerning any of the Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities (in the case of Seller) or Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities (in the case of Purchaser) (including information obtained in the course of any arbitration, in discovery pursuant to this Section 7.2(h) or concerning the Escrow Fund or claims for indemnification (including information concerning the assertion, existence, nature, amount, status or outcome of any claim, objection, communication or proceeding under this Article 7).</text>
        <page>68</page>
        <pageUUID>47aeaa70-4a0d-11f0-8d00-be44a5e954c9</pageUUID>
        <text>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party shall be entitled (i) to make such disclosures as are reasonably required in good faith for the conduct of proceedings for the resolution of disputes relating to indemnification claims, for the enforcement of arbitration awards and judgments related thereto, (ii) to disclose such information to their Representatives and other Persons who reasonably need to know such information for the purpose of enabling an Indemnified Party to assert and pursue an indemnification claim or enabling an Indemnified Party to respond or pursue an objection to an indemnification claim and who have agreed in writing to the same confidentiality obligations and disclosure restrictions applicable to the Parties hereto) and (iii) to make such disclosures as required by Law (including federal and state securities Laws) or by stock exchange rules.</text>
        <text>(i) Third-Party Claims. In the event that an Indemnified Party is served with a complaint, counterclaim or cross-claim in litigation (a “Third-Party Claim”) which the Indemnified Party expects may result in a claim for indemnification under this Article 7 or a demand against the Escrow Fund, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of such Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its own and sole expense, to participate in any defense of such Third-Party Claim. Purchaser shall have the right in its sole and absolute discretion to control the defense of any Third-Party Claim against Purchaser and Purchaser shall thereafter from time to time promptly provide to Seller copies of all pleadings filed and all Orders issued in such Action or Proceeding relating to such Third-Party Claim, and shall consult in good faith with Seller at reasonable periodic intervals on matters regarding the defense of such Third-Party Claim. Purchaser shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise any such Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that (i) the amount of any settlement shall only be indemnifiable if made with the consent of the Indemnifying Party or, if made without the consent of the Indemnifying Party, the amount of the settlement was not unreasonably high, does not result in the Indemnifying Party incurring any obligations other than its indemnification obligations hereunder or the settlement was not agreed to in bad faith and without any reasonable basis, (ii) the amount of any settlement shall not be determinative of the amount of Losses (if any) that are subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article 7 and (iii) in no event shall Purchaser settle any claim related to the matter set forth in Item 5 of Part II of Schedule 7.2(b)(iv) without the consent of Seller. If a Third-Party Claim in a pending Action or Proceeding against an Indemnified Party would reasonably be expected to result in a claim for indemnification under this Article 7, then, at the Indemnifying Party’s written request within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice of the institution or pendency of such Action or Proceeding, (A) the Indemnifying Party shall thereafter from time to time promptly provide to the Indemnified Party copies of all pleadings filed and all Orders issued in such Action or Proceeding relating to such Third-Party Claim and shall thereafter consult in good faith with the Indemnifying Party at reasonable periodic intervals on matters relating to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, and (B) the Indemnifying Party may, with legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim if, and only if, (w) the Third-Party Claim is asserted by a Person other than a Governmental or Regulatory Authority, is solely for actual monetary damages (and not for punitive, exemplary or similar damages, treble damages or other damages in excess of actual damages), does not seek a declaratory judgment, injunctive or other equitable relief, or specific performance, and the total monetary damages that may be awarded with respect to such Third-Party Claim do not exceed</text>
        <page>– 69 –</page>
        <pageUUID>47aeaeda-4a0d-11f0-8d00-be44a5e954c9</pageUUID>
        <text>the lesser of five million dollars ($5,000,000) or the amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund after deducting therefrom the amount of all outstanding unpaid and/or unresolved claims for indemnification, (x) the Person asserting the Third-Party Claim is not a customer, supplier or strategic partner of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries and is not party to a material business relationship with the Indemnifying Party that may create a material risk of a conflict between the interests of the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect to the defense of the Third-Party Claim, (y) the Third-Party Claim does not involve a criminal, quasi-criminal or regulatory matter, and (z) no later than twenty (20) days after notice by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have notified the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to assume such defense and shall have acknowledged unconditionally that such Third-Party Claim is subject to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article 7. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense of such a Third-Party Claim, (AA) the Indemnifying Party shall thereafter from time to time promptly provide to the Indemnified Party copies of all pleadings filed and all Orders issued in such Action or Proceeding relating to such Third-Party Claim, and shall consult in good faith with the Indemnified Party at reasonable periodic intervals on matters regarding the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (BB) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in such Action or Proceeding at its own expense; (CC) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, default or confess or consent to the entry of judgment or any similar action with respect to any such Third-Party Claim or enter into or agree to any settlement of any such Third-Party Claim (other than a settlement solely for payment of money within the amounts set forth in clause (B)(w) above that contains a full release in favor of the Indemnified Party and its Subsidiaries). If thereafter the Third-Party Claim shall be amended or supplemented such that it no longer meets the criteria set forth in clauses (A) through (B) above, or if at any time after the assumption of control of defense the Indemnifying Party is failing, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party after written notice to the Indemnifying Party and reasonable opportunity for cure, to pursue the defense of such Third-Party Claim with reasonable diligence and vigor, the Indemnified Party may, upon written notice to the Indemnifying Party, re-assume the control and conduct of the defense of such Third-Party Claim. Where an Action or Proceeding also involves claims that are not subject to indemnification under this Article 7, the Indemnifying Party’s rights with respect to control of defense shall not extend to claims that are not subject to indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall have the right (and, at Seller’s request, the obligation) to conduct and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim to the extent that it is for (and is acknowledged by Purchaser to be) an Assumed Liability and Seller shall have the right (and, at Purchaser’s request, the obligation) to conduct and control the defense of any Third-Party Claim to the extent that it is for (and is acknowledged by Seller to be) a Retained Liability.</text>
