        <text>(c) Each employee eligible to participate in the DPSG Management Incentive Plan or any other incentive compensation plan, shall be entitled to receive, at such time as payments with respect to calendar year 2018 would normally be paid without regard to the Transactions, a payment equal to the greater of such employee’s (i) pro-rata target under the DPSG Management Incentive Plan or other incentive compensation plan for the period between January 1, 2018 and the Closing Date and (ii) the actual incentive award for such period under the DPSG Management Incentive Plan or other incentive compensation plan, provided that such employee has either remained employed by DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiary through December 31, 2018, or such employee’s employment has terminated under such circumstances as would, under the applicable terms of the DPSG Management Incentive Plan or other incentive compensation plan, entitle such employee to receive a payment under such plan with respect to calendar year 2018 notwithstanding such termination of employment. Prior to the Effective Time, Maple Parent and DPSG shall negotiate in good faith to establish new incentive compensation plans (the “Replacement 2018 Incentive Compensation Plans”) with respect to the portion of the 2018 calendar year following the Effective Date applicable to each Continuing Employee eligible to participate in the DPSG Management Incentive Plan for 2018 or any other incentive compensation plan. The Replacement 2018 Incentive Compensation Plans shall in each case be no less favorable to each eligible Continuing Employee than the incentive compensation plan or plans provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, after taking into account the effect of the Transactions and the payments contemplated by the first sentence of this Section 7.07(c).</text>
        <text>(d) After the Effective Time, DPSG shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any pre-existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any group health plans with respect to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) credit each Continuing Employee for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made and (iii) credit each Continuing Employee with service credit for such Continuing Employee’s employment for purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under each applicable benefit plan, as if such service had been performed with DPSG, provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits.</text>

As soon as reasonably practicable after DPSG delivers to Maple Parent a written request therefor, Maple Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by DPSG relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A) through (D) of the immediately preceding sentence; provided, that neither Maple Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney client or similar privilege to the extent such privilege is asserted in good faith or otherwise would violate or contravene any law, rule or regulation or any obligation of confidentiality.</text>
        <text>(e) Unless, and to the extent, Maple Parent shall have sufficient immediately and unconditionally available cash from other sources (including the Equity Financing and/or by reason of capital markets, securities or other financing transactions) available to pay the Required Amount, from and after the execution of this Agreement, Maple Parent shall not amend, modify, replace, terminate or agree to any waiver under the Debt Commitment Letter without the prior written approval of DPSG if such amendment, replacement, modification, termination or waiver would (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing such that the aggregate funds that would be available on the Closing Date, together with other immediately and unconditionally available sources, would not be sufficient to pay the Required Amount, (ii) impose new or additional conditions to the Debt Financing or otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any of the conditions to the Debt Financing (unless such expanded, amended or modified conditions could not be reasonably expected to prevent, impede or delay the funding of the Debt Financing or impose additional material obligations upon DPSG or any DPSG Subsidiary), or (iii) otherwise expand, amend, modify or waive any provision of the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that in any such case would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or make less likely the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing) on the Closing Date or (B) adversely impact the ability of Maple Parent to enforce or cause the enforcement of its rights against the Financing Sources; provided, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Maple Parent may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. In the event that new commitment letters and/or fee letters are entered into in accordance with any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification of the Debt Commitment Letter permitted pursuant to this Section 7.08(e) such new commitment letters and/or fee letters shall be deemed to be the “Debt Commitment Letter” for all purposes of this Agreement and references to “Debt Financing” herein shall include and mean the financing contemplated by the Debt</text>

Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Alternative Financing, such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the “Debt Financing” and any commitment and fee letters for such Alternative Financing shall be deemed the “Debt Commitment Letter” for all purposes of this Agreement.</text>

        <text>(j) On or prior to the Closing, Maple Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the agent under the Maple Credit Agreement to provide a copy of an executed payoff letter (the “Maple Parent Payoff Letter”) with respect to the Maple Credit Agreement, in customary form, the Maple Parent Payoff Letter shall (i) indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs and any other monetary obligations then due and payable (and not contingent or unasserted) under the Maple Parent Payoff Letter as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily accrual thereafter) (the “Maple Parent Payoff Amount”), (ii) state that upon receipt of the Maple Parent Payoff Amount under such Payoff Letter, the Maple Credit Agreement and all related loan documents shall be terminated, as applicable and (iii) provide that all Liens and all guarantees (if any) in connection therewith relating to the assets and properties of the Maple Parent or any Maple Parent Subsidiary securing such obligations shall be, released and terminated upon the payment of the Maple Parent Payoff Amount.</text>

If such prepaid D&amp;O Insurance has been obtained by DPSG prior to the Effective Time, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 7.09(c) and DPSG shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such D&amp;O Insurance to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder.</text>
