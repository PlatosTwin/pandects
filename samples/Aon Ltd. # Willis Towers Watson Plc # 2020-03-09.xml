    <text>BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT</text>
    <text>This BUSINESS COMBINATION AGREEMENT (hereinafter referred to as this “Agreement”), dated March 9, 2020, is by and between Aon plc, a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, with registered company number 07876075 (“Aon UK”) and Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company, an Irish public limited company (“WTW”). All capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in Section 10.5 or as otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context clearly provides otherwise. Aon UK and WTW are referred to collectively herein as the “Parties”, and Aon UK, on the one hand, and WTW, on the other hand, are each sometimes referred to herein as a “Party”.</text>
    <text>RECITALS</text>
    <text>WHEREAS, each of WTW and Aon UK desire to effect a strategic combination of their businesses, it being the intent of each of WTW and Aon UK to create a leading, next-generation global professional services firm that is uniquely positioned to redefine client value creation and drive innovation in future risk, retirement and health solutions, three of the largest categories in an increasingly volatile global economy;</text>
    <text>WHEREAS, the Parties wish to effect such strategic combination through a proposed scheme of arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Act to effect the Acquisition pursuant to this Agreement, on such terms and in such form as is consistent with the terms agreed to by the Parties as set out in the Rule 2.5 Announcement, including any revision thereof as may be agreed between the Parties in writing, and, if required, by the High Court (the “Scheme”) although, this may, subject to the consent (where required) of the Panel, be switched to a Takeover Offer in accordance with the terms set out in this Agreement;</text>
    <text>WHEREAS, the board of directors of WTW (the “WTW Board of Directors”) has unanimously determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Acquisition, including the Scheme and the Post-Completion Merger if the Two-Step Certification is provided (together, the “Transactions”) are fair and reasonable to WTW and its stockholders;</text>
    <text>WHEREAS, the WTW Board of Directors has unanimously adopted resolutions approving the Scheme, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions and declaring them fair and reasonable and recommending that the WTW Shareholders vote in favor of the Resolutions at the Court Meeting and at the WTW EGM (the “WTW Board Recommendation”);</text>
    <text>WHEREAS, the Aon UK board of directors (“Aon UK Board of Directors”) has unanimously adopted resolutions approving the Acquisition and the execution of this Agreement and, upon the completion of the Aon CSA and the Required Assignment, the Aon Board of Directors will direct that the issuance of Aon Shares in connection with the Acquisition be submitted for consideration at the Aon EGM and has resolved and will resolve to recommend that the holders of Aon Shares (the “Aon Shareholders”) vote to approve such issuance (the “Aon Board Recommendation”);</text>
    <pageUUID>399384f6-4a0d-11f0-8d00-be44a5e954c9</pageUUID>
    <text>WHEREAS, Aon Limited, a company incorporated in Ireland (“Aon Ireland”), is presently a wholly owned subsidiary of Aon UK;</text>
    <text>WHEREAS, pursuant to the proxy statement filed by Aon UK with the SEC on December 20, 2019, after Aon Ireland converts to a public limited company in Ireland, Aon UK will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aon Ireland, and Aon Ireland will become the publicly traded parent company of Aon UK, by means of a Cancellation Scheme of Arrangement under Part 26 of the UK Companies Act 2006 (the “Aon CSA”);</text>
    <text>WHEREAS, concurrently with or immediately following the Aon CSA, Aon UK will assign to Aon Ireland, and Aon UK shall cause Aon Ireland to assume from Aon UK, all of Aon UK’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Expenses Reimbursement Agreement(the “Required Assignment”), which assignment is subject to Section 10.13 (and for the avoidance of doubt, WTW hereby consents to such assignment);</text>
    <text>WHEREAS the Parties hereto intend that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Scheme and the receipt of the Scheme Consideration in exchange for the WTW Shares (and, if the Two-Step Certification is provided, together with the Post-Completion Merger) qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the “Intended Tax Treatment”), and this Agreement is intended to be, and hereby adopt this Agreement as, a “plan of reorganization” within</text>
    <text>the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and Treasury Regulations sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3; and</text>
    <text>WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Acquisition and also prescribe various conditions to the Acquisition.</text>
    <text>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:</text>

Each of WTW and Aon will use reasonable best efforts to minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result from the requests for access, data and information hereunder. No inspection by either Party or any of its respective Representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive any of the representations and warranties of the other Party set forth in this Agreement.</text>

        <text>(c) Each of WTW and Aon will hold, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant to this Section 8.1, in confidence to the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (and the Clean Team Agreement, if applicable). Notwithstanding anything in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the term “Representatives” (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) shall thereafter be deemed to include financing sources of Aon.</text>

The failure to deliver any such notice shall not affect any of the Conditions or give rise to any right to terminate under Article IX.</text>
        <text>(e) Each of WTW and Aon may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 as “Outside Counsel Only Material.” Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient and, subject to the Clean Team Agreement and any additional confidentiality or joint defense agreement the Parties may mutually propose and enter into, will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials (WTW or Aon, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.</text>
